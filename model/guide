# Some explain might help you to approach the model
File .ipynb that you can run on Google Colab will give you all the process we do to abtain the model

With the file zip, you can download it to see the results.

1.I recommend you should install ubuntu on Windows. It can be easier to do the next step.
You can install WSL with 1 or 2 command in terminal or read here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

2.Install miniconda for linux

3.One you installed miniconda: 
  ~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash
  ~/miniconda3/bin/conda init zsh
  conda create -n andromaldetect python=3.10
  conda activate andromaldetect

4. Unzip the demomodel and install some packages:
   sudo apt install unzip
   unzip file you download 
   pip install androguard
   pip install loguru
   pip install streamliy
   pip install streamlit
   pip install torch-geometric
   pip install tensorflow==2.15
   pip install torch
   git clone https://github.com/bdqnghi/infercode.git
   pip install tree-sitter==0.21
   cd infercode/
   pip install .
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt-get install graphviz graphviz-dev
   conda install pygraphviz
5. Open folder demo and run:
    streamlit run app.py

If you installed everything right, you can run the model, and the terminal will give you the ip address to go the web, where you can put an random APK file to the the results.
#Good luck
#If the guide don't make sense to you, check the command i run before on Ubuntu but note that some command i run that fail or wrong but it may help.
