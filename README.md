# Detected-Malware-APK-base-on-Deep-Learning

We developed a machine learning model to detect APK files containing malware.

Here's an overview of the model

1. We start by decompiling an APK file using Androguard to obtain the source code. From this, we can build a function call graph (FCG) to gain a better overview. However, one essential step is trimming the FCG to remove unnecessary nodes, which helps maintain the model's efficiency.
You can install Androguard here: https://github.com/androguard/androguard

2. For transforming the source code into a vector representation, we chose Infercode as our model. However, other models such as Code2Vec, Node2Vec, and Word2Vec are also highly effective options.

3. Once we have the vector representations for each APK file, the next step is to condense these vectors into a single tensor for easier classification. This is why we chose Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), a type of neural network for deep learning. By training this model, we obtain a unique feature vector representing the entire graph after passing through GIN.
There are a lot of model around GIN, you can see many stuffs on Google.

4. And then with Random Forest, We can classify labels based on vectors.



You can download the dataset here or you can find another dataset from anywhere. It depends on how large your model you want it to be.
